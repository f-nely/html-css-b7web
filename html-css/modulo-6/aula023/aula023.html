        <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
        <q>Stay hungry, stay foolish.</q>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com">
          You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them
          looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow
          connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut,
          destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down,
          and it has made all the difference in my life.
